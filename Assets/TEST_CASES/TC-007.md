# Test Case — TC-007: Does zoom and panning work as expected
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify camera zoom and pan controls: min/max clamp, smooth interpolation, world-bound enforcement, interaction reachability at all zoom levels, and persistence if design requires.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` with active camera controller and player controller (if camera follows player).  
- Camera controller exposes configurable min/max zoom, pan speed, and interpolation settings.  
- Input methods available: mouse (wheel + drag), keyboard, touch/pinch (if supported).  
- Farm/world bounds defined.  
- Console cleared before test.

## Test Data
- Zoom levels: configured MinZoom, MidZoom, MaxZoom (document values from CameraController).  
- Pan positions: center, four cardinal edges, and corners of farm bounds.  
- Window sizes/resolutions: 1920×1080, 1280×720, 800×600.  
- Tolerances:
  - Zoom clamp: exact min/max must not be exceeded.
  - Smoothness: no visible jump when changing zoom (interpolation <= 200ms for small steps, subjective).
  - Pan reachability: no dead zones; camera must not reveal invalid empty areas.

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
**Given** the game is running in `GameScene` with the camera centered on the farm.
**When** the player uses zoom controls mouse wheel to zoom in and out and mouse drag to pan the camera around the farm area.
**Then** the camera should zoom in and out smoothly, clamping at min/max zoom levels without exceeding them.
**Then** the camera should pan smoothly in all directions, respecting farm/world boundaries 
## Expected Results
- Zoom clamps at configured min/max  
- no visual bugs at any zoom level.
- camera pans smoothly without jitter.
- zooming and panning should not result in visual artifacts or glitches.
- No console errors, exceptions, or significant performance regressions.

## Cleanup
- Reset camera position and zoom to defaults.  
- Restore window resolution if changed.  
- Clear console logs.
