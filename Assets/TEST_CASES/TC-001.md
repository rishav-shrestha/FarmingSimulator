# Test Case — TC-001: Farm grid generation on scene load
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify that the `TileManager` generates the farm grid correctly when a new game or save game is loaded: correct tile count, correct world positions, no overlapping tiles, and consistent spacing/origin alignment.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` contains a `TileManager` component responsible for generating the farm grid.  
- Launch path: Start from `MainMenu` and choose `New Game` or `Load`.  
- Unity Editor on Windows (mouse + keyboard).  
- Tile prefab and any required resources (sprites, colliders) are present and referenced in `TileManager`.

## Test Data
- Grid sizes to test: `Width×Height` = `10×10`, `20×15`, `30×30`.  
- TileSpacing: use value from `TileManager.TileSize` (document this value in the test run).  
- Tolerances:
  - Position tolerance: ±0.01 world units for tile placement.
  - Count tolerance: exact match expected (no missing/extra tiles).
  - Overlap tolerance: tiles must not overlap (no intersecting colliders/bounds).

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
 **Given** the `MainMenu` is open and the `GameScene` contains a `TileManager` with editable `Width`, `Height`, and `TileSize` properties.  
 **When** you set `TileManager.Width` and `TileManager.Height` to one of the test sizes (`10×10`, `20×15`, `30×30`) in the Inspector before entering Play Mode.  
 And you note the configured `TileSize` (spacing) value.  
 **Then** press Play, choose `New Game` (or `Load`) and wait until the `GameScene` finishes grid generation.  
 Repeat steps 2–5 for each test grid size.

## Expected Results
- Total instantiated tiles = `Width × Height` for each tested configuration.  
- Every tile position equals expected grid coordinates within ±0.01 units.  
- No overlapping tiles (no intersecting colliders or overlapping sprite bounds).  
- Each tile has the required components (`FarmTile` script, collider, renderer).  
- No missing or duplicated tiles.  
- No console errors or exceptions during generation.  
- Scene remains responsive and generation completes in a reasonable time for tested sizes.

## Notes
- If `TileManager` supports an origin/anchor option (centered vs. corner), test both modes and document expected position calculations.  
- Consider automated PlayMode tests that instantiate `TileManager` and assert positions/counts to avoid manual inspection.  
- Edge cases: zero or negative width/height, extremely large sizes, or non-integer `TileSize`. Document behavior (fail gracefully / clamp / error).

## Cleanup
- Reset `TileManager.Width`, `TileManager.Height`, and `TileSize` to default values.  
- Destroy generated tile GameObjects or reload `GameScene` to restore scene state.  
- Clear console logs before finishing.
