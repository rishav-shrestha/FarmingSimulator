# Test Case — TC-005: Does harvesting crops increase crop amount in inventory
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify that harvesting a crop at its harvestable stage adds the correct item(s) and quantity to the player's inventory, respects stack limits/overflow behavior, updates the tile state, and plays the appropriate audio/visual feedback.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` with farm layout and `TileManager` / `FarmTile`s present.  
- A crop instance exists on a `FarmTile` and is at a harvestable stage (per `CropDatabase` definition).  
- Player inventory (`Inventory`) component is accessible and configured (stack sizes defined).  
- Harvest tool or action available and mapped to input (or harvest API usable).  
- Audio clips for harvesting present and referenced by `AudioManager`.  
- Console cleared before test.

## Test Data
- Crops to test: single-yield crop (e.g., "Carrot") and multi-yield crop ("Tomato").  
- Crop inventory for different crops 
## Steps (Given–When–Then)
Scenario 1: Harvesting Single Yield Crop
** Given** a `FarmTile` with a harvestable "Carrot" crop and an inventory with no carrot.
** When** the player performs the harvest action on the crop.
** Then** the inventory should have 1 "Carrot" item added.
Scenario 2: Harvesting Multi-Yield Crop with Stack Limit
** Given** a `FarmTile` with a harvestable "Tomato" crop and no tomatoes in inventory.
** When** the player performs the harvest action on the crop.
** Then** the inventory should have the correct number of "Tomato" items added (e.g., 3 tomatoes).

## Expected Results
- Inventory reflects the correct increase in crop items after harvest.
- Crop is removed from tile after harvest
- Harvest sound plays without errors.

## Notes
- Test both single-yield and multi-yield crops.  
- Consider automated PlayMode tests that instantiate `Crop`, simulate inventory states, call harvest logic, and assert inventory and tile state.

## Cleanup
- Restore inventory to initial state or clear test items.  
- Destroy test crops/tiles or reload `GameScene`.  
- Clear console logs.
