# Test Case — TC-010: Does VolumeControl from main menu work
**Priority:** Low  
**Type:** PlayMode / Manual  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify the main menu's volume controls (master/FX/Music/Voice or project-specific channels) immediately affect in-game audio, mute/unmute behaves correctly, and volume settings persist across scene loads and game sessions if design requires.

## Preconditions
- Main menu scene is available and contains volume controls (slider(s), mute toggle).  
- `AudioManager` is present in project and referenced by the main menu UI (or volume setting API exists).  
- Audio clips for music and FX are present and audible.  
- Player can enter `GameScene` from `MainMenu` (New Game / Load).  
- Console cleared before test.

## Test Data
- Channels to test: Master , Music, SFX/FX.  
- Different Volume values 

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
**Given** the game is running and the main menu is displayed with volume controls.
**When** the player adjusts the volume sliders for Master, Music, and SFX channels individually.
**Then** the volumes should change immediately, and the corresponding audio (music, SFX) should reflect the new levels.
**Given** the volume sliders are set to non-zero levels.
**Then** the audio should be audible at any adjusted levels.
**When** the player slides the Master volume to zero.
**Then** all audio should mute immediately.
**When** the player changes Scenes
**Then** the audio should be at the same level.

## Expected Results
- Audio volume changes should be noticable immediately
- At zero volume, audio is fully muted.
- At non-zero volume, audio is audible.
- Audio levels are consistent across scene loads and game sessions.

## Cleanup
- Restore default volume levels or reset PlayerPrefs / saved settings used for testing.  
- Close and restart game/session if persistence was tested to confirm cleanup.  
- Clear console logs.
