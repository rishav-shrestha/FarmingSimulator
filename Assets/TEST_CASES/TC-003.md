# Test Case — TC-003: Does the action correlate with selected tool
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify that the currently selected tool determines which actions are allowed on `FarmTile`s and other interactable objects: correct-tool actions succeed, wrong-tool actions are prevented or produce expected feedback, and tool selection visuals/cursor update correctly.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` with accessible player, toolbelt/UI selection, and interactive `FarmTile`s.  
- Tools available: at minimum `Hoe`, `WateringCan`, and `Scythe` (or project equivalents).  
- Tool selection UI (`UIController` / toolbelt) and input mapping are functional.  
- Tool-specific action methods (e.g., `FarmTile.Till()`, `Crop.Water()`, `Crop.Harvest()`) exist and are referenceable.  
- Console cleared before test.

## Test Data
- Tools to test: `watering`, `planting`, `harvesting` 
- Tile states to test: `planted`, `empty`, `requires watering`, `harvestable`.  


## Steps (Given–When–Then)
**Given** the player is selecting planting tool and selected crop isnt null
**When** player clicks on an empty farm tile, then the tile should be planted with the selected crop
**Given**  the player has Watering tool, the player should be able to water the planted crop by clicking on the farm tile with the planted crop which requires watering
**Then** The watered crop should progess to the next stage
**Given** the player has Harvesting tool, the player should be able to harvest the fully grown crop by clicking on the farm tile with the fully grown crop
**Then** The harvested crop should be removed from the farm tile


## Expected Results
- Right tool should successfully perform its action on the appropriate tile/object state. 
- Wrong tool should not perform any action
- action should complete within a single input.
- No console errors or exceptions occur during tests.

## Cleanup
- Reset any modified tile states or reload `GameScene`.  
- Clear console logs.
