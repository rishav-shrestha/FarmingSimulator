# Test Case — TC-009: UI interaction — does the UI behave correctly
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** PlayMode / UI  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Validate core UI behaviour: buttons and clickable elements respond once per activation, tooltips appear/disappear as expected, focus and modal dialogs block input beneath them, and UI scales/remains usable across resolutions and input devices.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` or main menu scene with `UIController` active and connected UI elements (buttons, toolbelt, dialogs, tooltips).  
- Input devices: mouse + keyboard; controller/gamepad optional if supported.  
- Console cleared before test.  
- Relevant UI prefabs and event handlers referenced in `UIController`.

## Test Data
- Screens/resolutions to test: 1920×1080, 1280×720, 800×600.  
- UI elements to test: main menu buttons, toolbelt/tool buttons, inventory slots, modal dialog, tooltip-enabled buttons.  
- Tolerances: single activation must not trigger duplicate callbacks; visual state changes must appear within one frame (or immediately perceptible).

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
**Given** the game is running with `UIController` active and visible UI elements.
**When** the player clicks/taps on buttons
**Then** each button should respond exactly once per click/tap, triggering the intended action without duplicates.
**Then** Clicking on buttons should make appropriate visual and audio feedback.
**Given** a button is covering the farm tile
**Then** clicking on the button should not trigger any farm tile interaction.
**Given** Switching to different resolutions (1920x1080, 1280x720, 800x600).
**Then** The UI layout should not overlap and should be visible and usable at all tested resolutions.


## Expected Results
- UI elements respond exactly once per intended activation.  
- Farm tile interactions are not triggered when clicking on overlapping UI elements.
- UI layout scales properly across tested resolutions and dont overlap.  
- No console errors or exceptions during UI interactions.
- The button should only be pressed when clicked on visible area.

## Notes
- Test with slow/fast input to reveal race conditions (debounce/cooldown issues).

## Cleanup
- Close any open dialogs/panels opened during test.  
- Restore any modified UI settings (Canvas scaler, font sizes).  
- Clear console logs.
