# Test Case — TC-004: Growth progression and water requirement to get to next stage
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify crops advance growth stages only when configured growth conditions (time + watering) are satisfied. Confirm visual stage changes, internal stage counters/timestamps, UI indicators, and that growth stalls when watering requirements are unmet.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` with an active farm layout and interactive `FarmTile`s.  
- `CropDatabase` contains entries with per-stage durations and watering rules.  
- Crop prefab, sprites/animations, `FarmTile` and `Crop` scripts, and watering tool (or API) are present.  
- Able to start from `MainMenu` (New Game / Load) or run directly in Editor Play Mode.  
- Console cleared before test.

## Test Data
- Growth Timer: use short durations (e.g., 5s, 10s) for test stages to allow rapid verification.
- watering requirement: crops need water at all stages to progress to next stage except for last stage.

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
**Given a crop is planted on a valid FarmTile.

**Then after the configured growth time has passed, the crop requires watering to continue growing.

**Then verify this repeats for each growth stage until the crop reaches the final (harvestable) stage.

**When the watering tool is used, the crop advances to the next growth stage.

**When you go to the Crops folder in Assets and change the growth time in the crop data file,

**Then observe again in Play Mode to confirm the updated growth time is correctly applied and followed.

## Expected Results
- Non-watered crops do not advance to next stage.
- after the growth time has elapsed, the crop indicates it needs watering (inspector).
- Watered crops advance to the next growth stage after watering is applied.
- Sprite Changes to reflect advanment to the next stage.

## Notes
- Edge cases: missing `CropDatabase` entries, negative durations, or null sprites should fail.

## Cleanup
- Destroy test crops/tiles or reload `GameScene`.  
- Reset any modified settings (timeScale, test values).  
- Clear console logs.
