# Test Case — TC-002: Farm centered on screen on load
**Related issue:** #123  
**Priority:** High
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` with farm layout and defined farm center.  
- Launch from `MainMenu` via New Game or Load.  
- Unity Editor on Windows (mouse + keyboard).

## Test Data
- Farm center defined in the `TileManager` object.  
- Tolerance: Camera center must be within 5% of viewport size or 2 world units of the farm center.

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
1. **Given** the `MainMenu` is open and the `GameScene` has a `TileManager` object with defined `Width` and `Height` values for the farm grid.  
2. **When** you open the `TileManager` in the Inspector and adjust its `Width` and `Height` (e.g., `20×20`, `30×15`, `40×40`) to simulate different farm sizes before entering Play Mode.  
3. And in the Game window, open the resolution dropdown (top bar) and test different display sizes — `1920×1080`, `1366×768`, `1280×720`, and `800×600`.  
   - If not listed, click “+” → Add Resolution and enter custom width/height.  
4. **Then** press Play, select New Game or Load, and wait for the scene to finish loading.  
5. Observe whether the camera view is centered on the farm area at each tested resolution and farm size.

## Expected Results
- Camera center aligns within defined tolerance of the farm center.  
- Main farm tiles are visible on initial load (no parts of the farm off-screen).  
- UI overlays (HUD, menus) do not block the visible farm area.  
- No console errors or exceptions occur during scene load.

## Notes
- Test both windowed and fullscreen modes.  
- Edge cases: multiple spawn points in scene, farm center off-grid, camera auto-follow enabled.  
- Suitable for PlayMode automation (assert camera position and capture screenshot).

## Cleanup
- Reset the `TileManager` width and height to default values.  
- Reload `GameScene` or reset camera/controller state after test.
