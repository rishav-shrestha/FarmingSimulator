# Test Case — TC-008: Can you navigate around the farm at all widths and heights
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** PlayMode  
**Owner:** Rishav Shrestha  
**Status:** Ready

## Objective
Verify camera and player navigation behave correctly across window sizes and aspect ratios: panning, zooming, input responsiveness, no UI blocking of interactive world elements, and no camera clipping or jitter.

## Preconditions
- Scene: `GameScene` with player controller and camera controller active.  
- Farm grid present (from `TileManager`) and interactive tiles reachable.  
- Camera supports pan and zoom controls.  
- UI overlays present (HUD, toolbelt) and can be toggled/adjusted.  
- Test machine supports window resizing.

## Test Data
- Window sizes / resolutions to test:  
  - Small: 800×600  
  - Medium: 1280×720  
  - Large: 1920×1080  
  - Ultra-wide / tall: 2560×1080, 1080×1920 (if supported)  
- Zoom levels: min, mid, max (use camera controller settings).  
- Pan speeds: default and any adjustable values.  
- Tolerances: no input dead zones; camera movement should be smooth (no visible jitter); UI must not permanently block primary farm interaction area.

## Steps (Given–When–Then)
**Given** the game is running in `GameScene` with default camera and farm size and the camera is centered.
**When** the player drags the mouse around, the camera should move to the corresponding direction and every area of the farm should be reachable.
**Then** the camera should not clip through farm boundaries or show invalid areas.
**Given** the game window is resized to each test resolution in sequence.
**When** the player attempts to pan and zoom the camera at each resolution.
**Then** the camera should respond correctly, maintaining reachability of farm areas and smooth movement.

## Expected Results
- Interactive tiles remain reachable and UI does not block essential interactions.  
- Controls remain responsive at all tested window sizes and zoom levels.  
- Camera shoud not get stuck or clip through boundaries.
- No console errors or exceptions during tests.

## Notes
- If the camera has anchoring modes (centered vs. origin), test both modes and document differences.  
- Run tests both from `MainMenu` flow and by entering `GameScene` directly in Editor Play Mode.  
- Consider automating basic pan/zoom and click reachability checks with Editor PlayMode tests.

## Cleanup
- Restore window to default size, reset camera and player position/zoom.  
- Clear console logs.  
- Reload `GameScene` if required to restore state.
